Idle Timer management that performs actions after an amount of inactivity time of user within a specified time frame (or always) for Kodi. Optional switch off the TV with CEC on all actions (must supported on both devices).

You can also quickly set an idle timer by calling the addon directly. Choose from a list the desired idle time. The timer starts then immediately.

Actions are:
* Stop playing media, optional switch to home menu
* Quit Kodi
* Shutdown, hibernate, suspend or reboot
* Run a specified addon
* Change user profile
